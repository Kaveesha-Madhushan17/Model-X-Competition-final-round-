# Model-X Competition Final

## Project Overview

Sri Lankan businesses operate in an environment where national events, public sentiment, and external disruptions can influence day-to-day decisions. To support better adaptability and strategic planning, finalists are tasked with designing a real-time situational awareness platform that provides businesses with actionable, data-driven insights about what is happening across the country.

### Problem Description

Teams are required to build a system that collects, processes, and interprets real-time signals relevant to Sri Lanka’s socio-economic and operational environment. The platform could gather publicly available data from a variety of sources, such as:
- Local news websites
- Public social media indicators (e.g., trending discussions, emerging concerns)
- Open datasets or event streams relevant to Sri Lanka

#### Key Features
- National Activity indicators
- Major events, developments, disruptions, or topics gaining traction in the public space
- Operational Environment Indicators
- Risk & Opportunity Insights

#### Technical Guidance
- Choice of machine learning, analytics, or heuristic methods
- Web crawling, scraping, or API-based data acquisition strategies
- Data fusion, event detection, trend analysis, or anomaly detection techniques
- Visualization and communication of insights

Solutions do not need to focus heavily on NLP; teams may prioritize pattern detection, signal scoring, clustering, temporal analysis, or other non-text-dependent methods.

#### Evaluation Criteria
- Relevance & Insight Quality
- Technical Soundness
- Real-Time Design Thinking
- Interpretability & Communication Clarity
- Innovation

#### Deliverables
- A functional prototype or well-structured demonstration
- Video
- A GitHub repository with organized code and documentation
- Slide deck to be presented during the live pitching on 6th & 7th Dec

Tailoring the system to Sri Lanka’s context will position finalists to produce more accurate, actionable results - and ultimately enhance their chances of winning the competition.
